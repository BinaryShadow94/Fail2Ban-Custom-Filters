## Adding a new Fail2Ban filter
Before adding any filter, verify that it has been tested with the default settings of the logs.

If any log configuration modification is required, specify it by comments in the respective ".conf" files.

Respect the directory structure used (if the project grows, a directory will be created for each service).
Modify the Readme.md file to add the new filters to the list.
